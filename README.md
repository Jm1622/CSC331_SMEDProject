# CSC331_SMEDProject
A project by Jeremy Martin, Asher Mercado, Spencer Johnson, Tao Chen, and Ron Navarro for CSC 331.
A rudimetary social media event detection for Twitter and Reddit, currently only checks key matches and that is what it returns as events.

To install, you will need to get the required dependencies compiled into a jar. This can be done using maven with the included pom.xml file. When you run the application the locations.txt and map.html must be in the same folder as the Jar when you run the file.
